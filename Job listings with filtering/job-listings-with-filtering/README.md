## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learnt how to use React.js hook useContext for the first time to share state and state setter with multiple components which are nested in a complex way.

### Continued development

I want to continue using and improving upon my tailwind css skills and also using useContext hook more often whenever it is appropriate.

### Useful resources
