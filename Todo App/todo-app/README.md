## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned how to emplement dark/light mode theme swithing using tailwind css and how to apply different styles based on what the current theme is. I've also learned how to make an element draggable and also slot it next to a particular element on the DOM.

### Continued development

I'd like to involve dark/light mode theme switching in my future project, whenever necessary or appropriate.
